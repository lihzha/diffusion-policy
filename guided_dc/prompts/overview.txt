including:

1. task generation: task type, what objects to use (e.g., apple, microwave), success criteria
# we should also have an caterogy-level randomization built in the environment initialization process (e.g., red/green apple)
# we also need to consider what other datasets we can use

2. high-level planner: a task tree

tree, motion planning, object physical properties to randomize
